# 🤖 Teachable Machine – Thumbs Up / Thumbs Down Recognizer

This project is a simple *AI-powered web application* built using *Google's Teachable Machine* and *TensorFlow.js*.  
It can recognize *hand gestures* — specifically *Thumbs Up 👍* and *Thumbs Down 👎* — using your webcam in real time.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Using *Teachable Machine*, an easy no-code machine learning tool by Google, this model was trained to classify hand gestures based on image data provided through a webcam.  
After training, the model was exported to *TensorFlow.js* and integrated into a simple *HTML web page* for live predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time webcam-based gesture detection  
- Two classes: *Thumbs Up* and *Thumbs Down*  
- Built using *Teachable Machine* and *TensorFlow.js*  
- No external dependencies or server required — runs fully in the browser  
- Beginner-friendly AI project for learning  machine learning fundamentals

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) – For training the AI model  
- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) – For running the model in the browser  
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – For building the web interface

## 🪜 How It Works

1. *Model Training*
   - Created an *Image Project* in Teachable Machine  
   - Added two classes: Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down  
   - Collected around 50 sample images for each gesture using the webcam  
   - Trained the model directly in the browser  

2. *Model Export*
   - Exported the trained model as *TensorFlow.js format*  
   - Uploaded it to get a shareable model link  

3. *Web Integration*
   - Used JavaScript code to load and run the model in a web page  
   - Displayed live predictions (gesture name and confidence score)
